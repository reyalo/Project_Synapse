Thank knst, I have more update :

I use typedef vector<int> BigInt; to make one BigInteger

I use only with positive numbers.

In my code have the functioninitialize one BigInt :

BigInt a = Integer(string);
BigInt a = Integer(char[]);
BigInt a = Integer(int);
BigInt a = Integer(long long);

I have function print one BigInt :
Print(BigInt);

I have iostream BigInt : NEW
cin >> BigInt;
cout << BigInt;

I have operators on BigInt : have NEW
BigInt + BigInt   (the value return is BigInt)
BigInt + int      (the value return is BigInt)
++BigInt          (the value of BigInt set to BigInt+1 and the value return is BigInt)
BigInt += BigInt  (no return value)
BigInt += int     (no return value)

BigInt - BigInt   (the value return is BigInt, that is positive numbers)
BigInt - int      (the value return is BigInt)
--BigInt          (the value of BigInt set to BigInt-1 and the value return is BigInt)
BigInt -= BigInt  (no return value)
BigInt -= int     (no return value)

BigInt * BigInt   (the value return is BigInt)
BigInt * int      (the value return is BigInt)
BigInt *= BigInt  (no return value)
BigInt *= int     (no return value)

BigInt / BigInt   (the value return is BigInt)     (need optimal)
BigInt / int      (the value return is BigInt)     (NEW - quickly)
BigInt /= BigInt  (no return value)
BigInt /= int     (no return value)

BigInt % BigInt   (the value return is BigInt)
BigInt % int      (the value return is int, that is in [0..int-1])
BigInt %= BigInt  (no return value)
BigInt %= int     (no return value)

NEW : Compare 
         BigInt - BigInt
         BigInt - int

> , < , == , >= , <=  (the value return is bool) 

I have functions on BigInt :
max(BigInt, BigInt) (the value return is BigInt)
min(BigInt, BigInt) (the value return is BigInt)

gcd(BigInt, BigInt) (the value return is BigInt)
lcm(BigInt, BigInt) (the value return is BigInt)

sqrt(BigInt)        (the value return is BigInt)  
NEW : quickly : knst comment (http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/16380#comment-213120)

log(int, BigInt)    (the value return is int, log(int, BigInt) is small)

I hope you can check the correction of this code

Sorry for my bad English.

Hope have more comments to improve BigInt perfectly.
